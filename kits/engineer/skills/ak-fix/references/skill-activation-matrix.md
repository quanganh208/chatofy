# Optional capabilities by need

| Need                              | Capability                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear local failure               | Direct file reads, cause-aligned repair, relevant checker         |
| Unclear causal path               | `ak:debug` and one discriminating test                            |
| Repeated refuted hypotheses       | `ak:problem-solving` if reframing would help                      |
| Difficult evidence comparison     | `ak:fable-thinking` (sequential mode) for a decision/evidence log |
| Multiple viable fixes             | `ak:brainstorm` after diagnosis                                   |
| Complex phases                    | Existing plan and optional live progress tracking                 |
| Independent areas/issues          | Delegates with disjoint ownership when authorized and available   |
| Cross-module/public-contract risk | Independent review where available or required                    |
| Changed docs contract             | Smallest owning docs update                                       |

Quick does not automatically load any helper. Standard/deep add only the capabilities the
failure needs. `--advice`, `--review` and `--ultra` retain their explicit contracts. Pass current
scope and existing evidence so helpers do not repeat completed gates. Reuse resolved journal
preferences during finalization: `/ak:journal` follows SKILL.md's **Journal step — opt-out**.
Never infer git authorization from completing a fix.
