# Fixing

Repair a concrete symptom, prove its cause before editing, and verify the repaired behavior.
Capture or reuse outcome, constraints, non-goals and acceptance criteria. Locate the failing
path, direct callers and relevant tests; record the failing command or observed behavior.

## Modes

- `--auto`: default; continue within authorized scope through repair and verification.
- `--review`: explicit human review at each major step.
- `--quick`: a bounded cause-aligned repair using `references/workflow-quick.md`.
- `--parallel`: independent issues with disjoint ownership and available delegation.
- `--advice`: supervisor checkpoints described below.
- `--ultra`: post-diagnosis best-of-5 selection; conflicts with quick and parallel.

## Advisory supervision (`--advice`)

When `--advice` is present, run this skill under `kongming` supervision, as
defined by `../ak-brainstorm/references/advisory-supervision.md`. Load
`references/advisory-supervision-checkpoints.md` for supervisor identity and
model routing, the spawn checkpoints (after each step, when stuck, on any failed
verification, before a high-stakes decision), when to treat `--advice` as active,
and how supervision persists through a PR.

## Diagnose, repair and finish

Choose quick for a clear local cause, standard for multi-file work, and deep for architecture
or competing fixes. Read only that route. `references/diagnosis-gates.md` owns required cause
and verification evidence. Use a discriminating test for uncertainty; reasoning helpers are
optional, never an automatic activation chain. Preserve the opening scope and contracts.

Rerun the failing path after repair, then checks covering affected callers/contracts. Add a
regression test when it detects meaningful behavior; type/lint fixes can use their existing
checker. Reuse checks for unchanged source, inputs and environment. Review the actual diff;
independent review scales with risk and repository requirements, not every trivial fix.

Repair your regressions within the authorized scope. Ask only for a material missing decision,
a contract reversal or an unauthorized destructive action. After three failed repair attempts,
stop and reconsider the architecture with the user and evidence. With `--advice`, obtain
counsel on every failed verification before re-diagnosis or edits, including in quick mode.

Finalize by reconciling an existing plan if present, updating impacted docs and reporting
cause, changed paths, verification and limitations. Use available tracking; no missing
Engineer-only skill blocks a local fix. Commit or publish only when already authorized.

### Journal step — opt-out

Skip the automatic `/ak:journal` step when either applies:

- The invocation includes the `--skip-journal` flag, OR
- `ak config prefs resolve --json | jq -r 'if .prefs.journal.auto == false then "false" else "true" end'` returns `false`. If the command errors or prints anything other than the exact string `false`, treat as `true` (default) — corrupt or missing config never suppresses the automatic journal.

Precedence: flag > project config > user config > default (`true`).
When skipped, print one line:

- `journal skipped by --skip-journal` (flag), or
- `journal skipped by preference` (config).

Explicit `/ak:journal` and `ak journal create` are unaffected. The opt-out covers the journal step only; the rest of the Finalize block still runs.

## Ultra Verifier Mode (`--ultra`)

`--ultra` is the best-of-5 wave defined by
`../ak-brainstorm/references/ultra-verifier-mode.md`. It fans ONLY the Step 3
solution selection to five independent read-only fix-plan candidates, which never
re-derive the confirmed root cause; one verifier then selects the single winning
fix plan. It hard-conflicts with `--quick` and `--parallel`. Load
`references/ultra-verifier-mode-fix.md` for the evidence packet, candidate task,
rubric, finalizer, and conflict handling.
