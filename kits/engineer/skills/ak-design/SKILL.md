# Design

Own art direction, brand identity and visual deliverables. UI implementation belongs to the
installed frontend-design/frontend-development/ui-styling capability; do not treat this as a
React or Tailwind recipe. Resolve brief, audience, brand assets, format and acceptance first.
For a named real brand load `references/brand-asset-protocol.md`; never fabricate its logo.
Reuse settled preferences and ask only for a material missing decision.

## Select the deliverable

| Deliverable | Load |
|---|---|
| Logo | `references/logo-builtin-usage.md` |
| Corporate identity | `references/cip-builtin-usage.md` |
| Slides | `references/slides-create.md` |
| Banner | `references/banner-sizes-and-styles.md` |
| Poster | `references/poster-builtin-usage.md` |
| Social image | `references/social-photos-design.md` |
| Icons | `references/icon-builtin-usage.md` |

Additional end-to-end examples live in `references/deliverable-recipes.md`; open only the
selected section. Use `references/design-workflow.md` for new/vague briefs and
`references/design-critique-guide.md` for concept, brand, legibility and output review.
Inspect exports for clipping, resolution and visual fidelity; report limitations honestly.
