# Repository packing

Choose the smallest scope that contains the requested module and necessary dependencies.
Inspect existing Repomix config/ignore rules and preserve secret exclusions. Determine local
or remote source, revision, output format and destination; do not pack a whole monorepo for
one module unless dependencies require it.

Use the installed CLI help for version-sensitive options; `references/cli-recipes.md` contains
setup and examples. Existing configuration guidance lives in `references/configuration.md`
and task examples in `references/usage-patterns.md`.

Run the scoped pack, inspect included files/token summary and secret-check warnings, then
verify no required dependency was omitted or sensitive content included. Reuse a previous
pack only when input file hashes, revision and config are unchanged. Report source/revision,
scope, output path, counts and limitations. Never disable secret checks just to obtain output.
