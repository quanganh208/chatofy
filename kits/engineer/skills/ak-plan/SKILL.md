# Plan (`ak:plan`)

Create structured, verifiable implementation plans with phased execution roadmaps, architecture diagrams, and testing strategies.

## Plan Location & Invariants

- **Location**: All plans live under `plans/<timestamp>-<descriptive-slug>/`.
- **Primary Files**: `plan.md` (index/summary) and `phase-NN-<name>.md` (execution details).
- **HTML Artifact**: When `--html` is passed, `plan.html` is the authoritative user-facing plan deliverable.
- **Task Hydration**: Phases hydrate into project task management unless `--no-tasks` is specified.

## Mode & Subcommand Routing

| Mode / Subcommand | Flag / Argument | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-Detect** | (none) | Analyzes task complexity and chooses appropriate mode | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Fast** | `--fast` | 0 research; direct analysis and rapid plan creation | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Hard** | `--hard` | Deep research, codebase scouting, red-team review, validation | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Deep** | `--deep` | Multi-phase exploration for complex/large-scale migrations | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Parallel** | `--parallel` | Generates parallel-executable phases with strict file ownership | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Two Approaches** | `--two` | Compares two distinct architectural approaches with trade-offs | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Debate** | `--debate` | Persona debate before selecting the optimal strategy | `references/workflow-modes.md` |
| **Ultra** | `--ultra` | Best-of-5 verifier pass; strongest-model selection | `../ak-brainstorm/references/ultra-verifier-mode.md` |
| **Validate** | `validate <path>` | Runs critical questions validation gate on a plan | `references/validate-workflow.md` |
| **Red-Team** | `red-team <path>` | 4-persona adversarial review (Assumptions, Failure, Scope, Security) | `references/red-team-workflow.md` |
| **Archive** | `archive [slug]` | Finalizes and archives closed/completed plans | `references/archive-workflow.md` |

## Flag Modifiers

- **`--html`**: Outputs a self-contained, interactive editorial HTML plan (`plan.html`). Follows the shared contract in `../ak-preview/references/html-skill-composition.md` (activates `ak:frontend-design` then `ak:diagram`). See `references/html-output.md`.
- **`--github`**: Creates/updates a GitHub issue with plan summary and links. See `references/github-wiki-publish.md`.
- **`--wiki`**: Publishes reviewed plan to AgentWiki. See `references/github-wiki-publish.md`.
- **`--advice`**: Runs under `kongming` advisory supervision and formats the output plan for handover to lower-capability executor models (Sonnet, Gemini Flash). Decomposes every phase into step-by-step tasks with explicit success criteria, marks verification steps with mechanical pass conditions, and embeds a Failure Protocol that stops and escalates to `kongming` on verification failure. See `references/advice-handover-plan.md` for the artifact contract and `../ak-brainstorm/references/advisory-supervision.md` for supervisor identity and model routing.
- **`--tdd`**: Enforces test-first design, test matrix, and verification commands in every phase.
- **`--no-tasks`**: Skips hydrating phases into task management.
- **`--yagni`**: Actively challenges and eliminates any scope not strictly necessary for the stated outcome (see `references/scope-challenge.md`).
- **`--skip-journal`**: Skips session journal entry generation during plan archive.
- **Visual Kill Switches**: `--no-antv`, `--no-diagram-design`, `--no-editorial-visuals` disable specific editorial visual layers (see `references/html-output.md`).

### Mode Exclusivity

The mode flags — `--fast`, `--hard`, `--deep`, `--parallel`, `--two`, `--debate`, `--ultra`, and this skill's own `--auto` (mode-detection, distinct from `/ak:cook`'s auto-approve `--auto`) — are mutually exclusive; Mode Detection is a single-choice step. Passing two is a hard stop naming both flags and the reason, never a silent override. `--auto` conflicts with every other mode flag since it is itself a mode-selection flag; `--debate` is explicit opt-in only and is never auto-selected.

## Planning pipeline

Resolve mutually exclusive modes and modifiers before reading their references. Reuse the
accepted outcome, constraints, non-goals and acceptance criteria. Load only the selected
route; fast plans do not automatically run debate, HTML or publishing. Plan files remain
execution authority; HTML is the requested presentation, not a replacement for phase state.


1. **Intake & Scope Challenge**: Inspect context, parse flags, evaluate scope (see `references/scope-challenge.md`).
2. **Research & Scout (Hard/Deep/Two)**: Spawn researchers and scout codebase paths (see `references/research-phase.md`, `references/codebase-understanding.md`).
3. **Plan Drafting**: Architect solutions and author phased roadmap files (see `references/solution-design.md`, `references/plan-organization.md`).
4. **Red-Team Gate (when selected mode requires it)**: Execute 4-persona review; resolve all blockers (see `references/red-team-workflow.md`).
5. **Validation Gate**: Run critical question framework; verify file ownership and test commands (see `references/validate-workflow.md`).
6. **Whole-Plan Sweep**: Verify links, frontmatter, and invariants across all phase files.
7. **HTML Artifact (if `--html`)**: Activate `ak:frontend-design` $\rightarrow$ `ak:diagram` $\rightarrow$ compile `plan.html` (see `references/html-output.md`).
8. **Hydrate Tasks**: Sync phases to live task management (unless `--no-tasks`, see `references/task-management.md`).
9. **GitHub / Wiki (if `--github` / `--wiki`)**: Post issue update and publish to AgentWiki (see `references/github-wiki-publish.md`).
10. **Handoff**: Report plan path, summary, and next execution step (`/ak:cook`).
11. **Journal**: Run `/ak:journal` to write a concise technical journal entry on completion. See the shared "Journal step — opt-out" block below.

### Journal step — opt-out

Skip the automatic `/ak:journal` step when either applies:
- The invocation includes the `--skip-journal` flag, OR
- `ak config prefs resolve --json | jq -r 'if .prefs.journal.auto == false then "false" else "true" end'` returns `false`. If the command errors or prints anything other than the exact string `false`, treat as `true` (default) — corrupt or missing config never suppresses the automatic journal.

Precedence: flag > project config > user config > default (`true`). When skipped, print one line: `journal skipped by --skip-journal` (flag) or `journal skipped by preference` (config). Explicit `/ak:journal` and `ak journal create` are unaffected.
