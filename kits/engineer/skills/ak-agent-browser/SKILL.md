# agent-browser Skill

Fast browser automation CLI for AI agents. Chrome/Chromium via CDP with accessibility-tree snapshots and compact `@eN` element refs .

Use `ak:agent-browser` for browser testing, screenshots, form fills, scraping, exploratory QA, bug hunts, cloud browsers, Electron apps, Slack automation, and flows where a fresh or tool-managed browser is fine. Prefer it over generic browser tools for profile-independent browser work.

Use `ak:chrome-profile` instead when the task needs the user's actual Chrome profile: existing cookies, logged-in sessions, a specific Google account, a tenant/workspace already open in daily Chrome, or deterministic targeting across multiple Chrome profiles.

For a missing binary/browser dependency or a requested upgrade, load `references/setup-and-upgrade.md`. Reuse a working binary; do not reinstall periodically.

## Start here — load live workflow content

This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide. Before running any `agent-browser` command, load workflow content from the installed CLI:

```bash
agent-browser skills get core             # start here: workflows, common patterns, troubleshooting
agent-browser skills get core --full      # include full command reference and templates
```

The CLI serves skill content from the installed binary, so instructions always match the installed version. This stub stays intentionally small and points at `skills get core` instead of duplicating command details that can change between releases.

## Specialized skills

Load a specialized skill when the task falls outside browser web pages:

```bash
agent-browser skills get electron          # Electron apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, Figma, ...)
agent-browser skills get slack             # Slack workspace automation
agent-browser skills get dogfood           # Exploratory testing / QA / bug hunts
agent-browser skills get vercel-sandbox    # agent-browser inside Vercel Sandbox microVMs
agent-browser skills get agentcore         # AWS Bedrock AgentCore cloud browsers
```

Run `agent-browser skills list` to see everything available on the installed version.

## When to use

Default for browser automation that does not depend on the user's real Chrome login state: autonomous sessions, ad-hoc navigation, screenshots, form fills, scraping, multi-tab work, self-verifying build loops, Electron desktop apps, Slack automation, and Browserbase/cloud browsers.

For low-level Chrome DevTools Protocol diagnostics, use the configured `chrome-devtools-mcp` bridge or client when one is available. Reason first: if the task does not need a specific real Chrome profile, Chrome DevTools MCP may use its normal navigation tools. If it does need profile/cookie/account state, use `ak:chrome-profile`; let `chrome-profile open --json` create the tab and bind to its returned selector before using MCP inspection tools. See `references/agent-browser-vs-chrome-devtools.md` for the trade-off.

## Why agent-browser

- Native Rust CLI rather than a Node.js wrapper
- Works across AI agents such as Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Continue, and Windsurf
- Chrome/Chromium via CDP without a Playwright or Puppeteer dependency
- Accessibility-tree snapshots with stable element refs for reliable interaction
- Sessions, authentication vault, state persistence, and video recording
- Specialized workflows for Electron apps, Slack, exploratory testing, and cloud browsers

## Cloud browsers

For CI/CD or environments without a local browser:

```bash
export BROWSERBASE_API_KEY="..."
export BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID="..."
agent-browser -p browserbase open https://example.com
```

See `references/browserbase-cloud-setup.md` for detailed setup. For AWS Bedrock AgentCore or Vercel Sandbox, run `agent-browser skills get agentcore` / `agent-browser skills get vercel-sandbox`.

## Observability dashboard

Agent Browser exposes an observability dashboard independently of browser sessions on port 4848. It can also be opened through a proxied or forwarded URL such as `https://dashboard.agent-browser.localhost`. Stay on the dashboard origin; session tabs, status, and stream traffic are proxied internally, so individual session ports do not need to be exposed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command not found              | `npm install -g agent-browser`                                             |
| Chromium missing               | `agent-browser install`                                                    |
| Linux deps missing             | `agent-browser install --with-deps`                                        |
| Stale commands / missing flags | `npm install -g agent-browser` then `agent-browser skills get core --full` |
| Session stale                  | `agent-browser close`                                                      |
| Element not found              | Re-run `agent-browser snapshot -i` after page changes                      |
