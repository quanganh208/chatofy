# Backend development

Build the requested API/backend behavior using the project's actual stack and conventions.
Inspect manifests, route/service boundaries, data ownership and tests before selecting a
framework or recipe. A REST endpoint fix does not authorize replacing auth or the database.

Match the change: API design, authentication integration, performance, architecture, testing
or deployment. Open the corresponding reference below; specialized database/auth/deployment
skills own work whose primary intent is that domain. New backend choices need constraints
and trade-offs. Verify version-sensitive guidance with the installed dependency and official
docs; no performance percentage in a recipe is evidence for this application.

Validate input, preserve server-owned authorization/state, expose stable errors, and verify
success/failure paths plus affected caller contracts. Broad implementation checklists live in
`references/implementation-checklist.md` and apply only to affected features.
