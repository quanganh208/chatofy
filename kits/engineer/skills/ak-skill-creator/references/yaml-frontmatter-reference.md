Kit skills in the AgentKit repository add `user-invocable`, `when_to_use`,
`category`, `keywords`, `argument-hint`, and `metadata.workflow`; the runtime
reads those fields. See `references/agentkit-kit-skill-contract.md`.

## Field Details

### name (required)

- Supports either `skill-name` or `namespace:skill-name` (for example `ak:plan`)
- If namespaced, namespace and skill id both use kebab-case only (no spaces, no capitals)
- Folder name must match the skill id segment (after `:`)
- Cannot contain "claude" or "anthropic" (reserved)

### description (required)

- At most 1024 characters; precise activation boundary without a minimum length
- Structure: `[What it does] + [When to use it]`; add a not-for boundary when useful
- Include trigger phrases users would actually say
- Mention relevant file types if applicable
- Direct phrasing such as "Use when..." is acceptable; see `references/metadata-quality-criteria.md`

### license (optional)

- Common: MIT, Apache-2.0
- Reference full terms in LICENSE.txt if needed

### compatibility (optional)

- 1-500 characters
- Environment requirements: intended product, system packages, network access

### allowed-tools (optional)

- Restricts which tools the skill can use
- Space-separated tool patterns

### metadata (optional)

- Any custom key-value pairs
- Suggested: author, version, mcp-server, category, tags

## Security Restrictions

**Forbidden in frontmatter:**

- XML angle brackets (`< >`) — frontmatter appears in system prompt, could inject instructions
- Skills named with "claude" or "anthropic" prefix (reserved)

**Allowed:**

- Standard YAML types (strings, numbers, booleans, lists, objects)
- Custom metadata fields
- Descriptions up to 1024 characters

## Description Examples

**Good — specific with triggers:**

```yaml
description: Analyzes Figma design files and generates developer handoff docs.
  Use when user uploads .fig files or asks for "design specs" or "design-to-code".
```

```yaml
description: Manages Linear project workflows including sprint planning and
  task creation. Use when user mentions "sprint", "Linear tasks", or "create tickets".
```

**Bad — vague or missing triggers:**

```yaml
description: Helps with projects. # Too vague
description: Creates sophisticated documentation systems. # No triggers
description: Implements the Project entity model. # Too technical
```
