# ak — safe CLI operation

Purpose: teach agents how to use the `ak` control-plane CLI without breaking
user-owned state. This skill owns the safe **operating model**, not the flag
reference. The generated appendix at
[`references/command-reference.md`](./references/command-reference.md) is a
starting index; `ak <cmd> --help` and `--json` output are always
authoritative.

## When to use vs when not to use

Use `ak:ak` when the next concrete action is:

- running an `ak` subcommand (`init`, `kit`, `skills`, `plan`, `journal`,
  `doctor`, `recover`, `self-update`, …);
- deciding between a read-only inspection command and a mutating lifecycle
  command;
- disambiguating project vs user/global scope, adapter, or delivery mode
  before a change lands somewhere the user did not expect;
- interpreting an `ak <cmd> --json` envelope.

Do **not** invoke for:

| Intent | Route to |
|--------|----------|
| Authoring or refining a Claude skill | `ak:skill-creator` |
| Writing or executing an implementation plan | `ak:plan`, `ak:cook` |
| Writing a technical journal entry | `ak:journal` |
| Choosing which installed skill fits a task | `ak:agentkit` (task router) |
| Any kit-specific workflow already covered by its own skill | that skill |

`ak:agentkit` decides *which skill runs*. `ak:ak` runs *the ak binary itself*.

## Safe operating protocol

Classify effects and resolve scope first. Reuse help and inspection evidence for the
same binary/version and target; refresh only when either changes or syntax is uncertain.

1. **Triage the goal.** Which category of the safety legend does the intent
   fall into?
   - `read-only` — never mutates disk, config, or remote state
   - `mutating` — installs, updates, removes, or writes durable state
   - `diagnostic` — long-running or interactive (TUI, GUI, watch, daemon
     serve); user judgement is the main side effect
2. **Inspect before acting.** Run `ak <cmd> --help` for the intended
   subcommand. For **read-only** scripted work also pass
   `--json --no-interactive` so the response is a versioned envelope
   (`schema_version`, `kind`, `data`) that can be parsed instead of scraped.
   Use supported `--no-interactive` or `--yes` within the user-authorized scope.
   Additive/reconcilable updates proceed without another approval. Destructive
   collision overwrites, unknown-content removal and state resets require a scoped
   preview, snapshot and authorization covering those specific effects.
   For human diagnostics, use `--verbose` on a safe read-only reproduction or
   the next authorized invocation. Never repeat a mutating command solely for
   diagnostic detail; inspect partial state and retry only within the existing authorization.
   `--quiet` overrides `--verbose`; `--verbose` does not change the typed JSON
   envelope.
3. **Confirm scope.** Where does this command act?
   - Project scope: current working tree; changes live under the project.
   - User/global scope: `~/.claude`, `~/.agents`, `~/.codex`, or the
     equivalent adapter home; changes affect every project.
   - Kit installation source (embedded vs remote registry vs local path).
   - Adapter/delivery mode (native emission vs plugin package). See the
     runtime support matrix before claiming a capability is active on any
     harness.
4. **Prefer status / inspect before lifecycle mutation.** Before `ak update`,
   `ak kit refresh`, `ak self-update`, `ak uninstall`, or `ak recover`, run
   the corresponding read-only path: `ak doctor`, `ak kit list-kits`,
   `ak kit validate`, `ak skill verify`, `ak plan status`, `ak sessions
   list`, `ak backups list`, `ak diagnostics export`, etc. Preview conflicts
   instead of guessing. **Snapshot before mutate:** before `ak recover`,
   `ak backups restore`, `ak uninstall`, or any command combined with
   `--fresh`, first run `ak backups create` (or confirm a current backup
   with `ak backups list`) so the mutation is reversible.
5. **Preserve unknown files.** AgentKit mutates only paths it owns. Never
   suggest `--force` combined with `--fresh`; never propose a destructive
   reset unless the user has explicitly asked. Surface a conflict; do not
   silently overwrite.
6. **Never run destructive commands against real maintainer state.** For
   installer/refresh/recovery smoke tests, use a fresh temporary home and
   set every applicable env var: `AGENTKIT_HOME`, `AGENTKIT_CLAUDE_HOME`,
   `CODEX_HOME`, cache/config/transcript/project paths. See
   [`docs/operations/implementation-smoke.md`](../../../../docs/operations/implementation-smoke.md).
7. **Report the exact command, scope, and result.** Include the resolved
   `--json` envelope where relevant. Name what changed on disk and any
   unresolved constraint (e.g. "matrix says cursor is production but the
   local install claims it as spike").

## Command families by task

Names below are the *task category*; the full command list with
classifications is in
[`references/command-reference.md`](./references/command-reference.md).
Use the appendix to find the exact command, then `ak <cmd> --help` for
flags.

- **Bootstrap and setup** — start here for a new project or a new machine.
  `ak init`, `ak new`, `ak setup`, `ak onboard`. All `mutating`.
  `ak setup` writes user config only. `ak onboard` runs setup, CLI login, then kit install.
- **Kits** — install, refresh, validate, and remove kits.
  `ak kit init|install|refresh|validate|uninstall|list-kits|repair-install-mode`.
  `ak kit list-kits` and `ak kit validate` are read-only; the rest mutate.
- **Skills** — inventory and per-skill environment.
  `ak skills list|show|search|install|remove|graph` for the inventory;
  `ak skill install|remove|repair|upgrade|verify` for one skill.
- **Agents, content, commands** — mirror the skills shape.
  Reads (`list`, `show`, `search`), writes (`install`, `remove`), and one
  domain-specific mutating action per group.
- **Plans and journals** — file-first plan and journal management. `ak plan
  list|show|status|search|validate|resolve|parse` are read-only. `ak plan
  create|check|uncheck|add-phase|update|use|archive|close|reindex|migrate`
  mutate the plan store or plan files. `ak plan kanban` is a diagnostic
  TUI. `ak journal list|show|validate` read; `ak journal create` writes.
- **Diagnostics** — `ak doctor`, `ak activity`, `ak audit`, `ak sessions`,
  `ak analytics`, `ak backups`, `ak versions`, `ak changelog`,
  `ak diagnostics export`. Nearly all read-only; enable/disable/delete
  under `analytics` and `content-search` are mutating.
- **Effectiveness** — `ak insights skills|agents|evidence|compare|improvements`
  read local quality, cost, time, uncertainty and coverage. `consent` changes
  collection/sharing only for supplied flags; `collect`, `record`, and
  `evaluate` write local evidence. A completed process is not acceptance.
  `skills` and `agents` support `--since`/`--until` in Unix milliseconds and
  `--previous-period` for descriptive changes across equally long windows.
  Keep configuration/evaluator revisions and unknown resource coverage visible;
  use paired evaluations before attributing improvement to a skill or runtime.
  `ak eval run <suite.json>` executes trusted commands in isolated workspaces
  and runtime homes; model calls may cost money. Inspect the suite first.
  `ak insights contribute preview --month YYYY-MM` freezes an aggregate
  locally. `contribute send --month YYYY-MM --digest <preview-digest>` sends
  that exact payload only with separate sharing consent and an approved HTTPS
  endpoint. Sharing defaults off; never infer remote grading consent.
- **Runtime orchestration** — inspect installed `ak orchestrate --help` first.
  `probe` runs bounded version/help checks and writes an owned metadata cache;
  it does not prove authentication or invoke inference. `prepare`, `advance`
  and `accept` persist resolved job/attempt and artifact evidence. `events`,
  `output` and `diagnose` inspect recorded evidence; `plan-status` and lifecycle
  `status`/`resume` may persist reclassification. External process supervision
  requires Darwin. Follow `all_settled` and cursor pagination, never infer all
  writers stopped from aggregate failure. Existing scoped user authorization
  remains valid across reconciliation; uncertain attempts must be inspected
  before replacement. Diagnostic bundles exclude private argv/environment.
- **Recovery** — `ak recover`, `ak backups restore`. Always confirm scope
  and preview before invoking; both are mutating and irreversible without
  a prior `ak backups create`.
- **Watch / daemons** — `ak watch start|stop|status|dry-run`,
  `ak content schedule daemon`, `ak codex-agent-runtime serve`,
  `ak api start|stop|status`, `ak config start|stop|status`. Long-running
  processes; `start` classifies as diagnostic, `stop` as mutating (it kills
  the process), `status` and `dry-run` as read-only.
- **Config, auth, and MCP** — `ak config prefs
  resolve|set|unset|validate`, top-level auth commands (`ak login`,
  `ak logout`, `ak whoami`, `ak licenses`), and `ak mcp
  add|link|list|remove|show|verify`. Writes here reach user-scope
  state; verify scope before invoking. Note: auth commands are
  top-level, not under an `ak auth` parent.
- **Selfupdate and migrations** — `ak self-update`, `ak migrate
  prefs|rollback`. Always run `ak versions` and check `ak changelog`
  before invoking; keep the installed skill copies in mind (see
  source-of-truth clause below — the binary can advance without the
  skill copies moving).

## Maintaining this skill

When an `ak` CLI command is added, removed, renamed, reparented, or changes
flags, scope, mutation behavior, or output, consider activating
`ak:skill-creator`. Update this skill when the change affects its operating
guidance, command classifications, examples, or safety rules. Regenerate
`references/command-reference.md` with `make skill-ref`; never hand-edit it.
Run `make skill-ref-check` to fail closed on stale output or unclassified
commands.

## Source-of-truth clause (do not remove)

The generated appendix carries a version stamp. If it lags behind
`ak --version`, treat the appendix as a **starting hint** and re-check
flags with `ak <cmd> --help` before any mutating call. `ak self-update`
advances the binary independently of installed skill content, so version
skew is normal after self-update and before the next `ak update` refresh.

Never rely on the appendix's flag list for a mutating command. The
authoritative surfaces, in order:

1. `ak <cmd> --help` (always current for the running binary)
2. `ak <cmd> --json` output (versioned envelope, parseable)
3. `references/command-reference.md` (starting index, may lag)

## Anti-patterns

- Do **not** combine `--force` with `--fresh` on any lifecycle command.
- Do **not** run installer, refresh, migration, uninstall, or destructive
  smoke tests against real maintainer state. Set a temp home per
  [`docs/operations/implementation-smoke.md`](../../../../docs/operations/implementation-smoke.md).
- Do **not** invent flags not present in `ak <cmd> --help`. The Cobra
  metadata is authoritative; if the flag is not there, it is not shipped.
- Do **not** treat a source-only capability as active in the installed
  binary. Confirm via `ak versions` or `ak doctor`.
- Do **not** infer adapter capability from another adapter. Check
  `docs/conformance/runtime-support-matrix.yaml` and adapter output.
- Do **not** hand-edit the appendix at `references/command-reference.md`;
  regenerate via `make skill-ref`.
- Do **not** report a mutating command's outcome without the resolved
  scope. "Installed the engineer kit" is not enough — say project vs
  global, adapter, and any conflict skipped.
