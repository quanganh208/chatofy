# Word documents

Preserve the original template, runs, formatting, comments and tracked changes. Mark only
changed text; retain unchanged run identity. Validate OOXML and inspect rendered output for
layout-sensitive changes. The full guide reads remain required by their routes until
consumer evidence establishes that shorter guidance preserves all content.

| Intent                                  | Load                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Extract/analyze                         | `references/extract.md`                       |
| Create                                  | `references/create.md` then full `docx-js.md` |
| Edit own document                       | `references/edit.md` then full `ooxml.md`     |
| Redline another/legal/business document | `references/redline.md` then full `ooxml.md`  |
| Render or missing dependencies          | `references/render-and-dependencies.md`       |

Validate the packed artifact, expected content and tracked-change granularity; report any
unavailable renderer instead of claiming visual verification.
