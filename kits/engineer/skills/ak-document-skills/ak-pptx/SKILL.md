# PowerPoint documents

Choose create, template, edit or extract before loading detail. Preserve template masters,
notes, relationships and untouched elements. Match layout to content; a dense table can
use a full slide and is not forced into two columns.

| Intent                  | Load                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Extract/analyze         | `references/extract.md`                         |
| Create without template | `references/create.md` then full `html2pptx.md` |
| Use template            | `references/template-workflow.md`               |
| Edit                    | `references/edit.md` then full `ooxml.md`       |
| Render/dependencies     | `references/render-and-dependencies.md`         |

Keep full format-guide reads until consumer validation supports narrowing them. Validate
XML when editing; render and inspect every output slide for loss, overlap, clipping and
contrast. Compare slide count, notes and expected content; report missing visual checks.
