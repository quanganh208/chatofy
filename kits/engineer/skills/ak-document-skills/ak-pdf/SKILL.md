# PDF processing

Choose the operation and validate its output:

| Operation                | Recipe                          | Acceptance                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Extract text/tables      | `references/extract-recipes.md` | Expected content, table alignment, page coverage      |
| Create                   | `references/create-recipes.md`  | Page size/count, readable content and rendered layout |
| Merge/split/rotate       | `references/page-recipes.md`    | Exact page count/order/orientation                    |
| Fill forms               | `forms.md`                      | Correct values and retained fillable fields           |
| OCR / watermark / images | `references/common-tasks.md`    | Scans recognized, content/layout retained             |
| CLI operations           | `references/cli-recipes.md`     | Same operation-specific checks                        |

An empty extraction from scanned pages requires visual inspection/OCR, not a conclusion of
no content. Preserve inputs and templates; inspect rendered pages for layout-sensitive work.
Use `reference.md` for advanced library/troubleshooting details. Report unavailable tools or
unverified dimensions without fabricating successful checks.
