# Context Degradation Patterns

Predictable degradation as context grows. Not binary - a continuum.

## Degradation Patterns

| Pattern | Cause | Detection |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Lost-in-Middle** | U-shaped attention | Critical info recall drops 10-40% |
| **Context Poisoning** | Errors compound via reference | Persistent hallucinations despite correction |
| **Context Distraction** | Irrelevant info overwhelms | Single distractor degrades performance |
| **Context Confusion** | Multiple tasks mix | Wrong tool calls, mixed requirements |
| **Context Clash** | Contradictory info | Conflicting outputs, inconsistent reasoning |

## Lost-in-Middle Phenomenon

- Information in middle gets 10-40% lower recall
- Models allocate massive attention to first token (BOS sink)
- As context grows, middle tokens fail to get sufficient attention
- **Mitigation**: Place critical info at beginning/end

```markdown
[CURRENT TASK]              # Beginning - high attention
- Critical requirements

[DETAILED CONTEXT]          # Middle - lower attention
- Supporting details

[KEY FINDINGS]              # End - high attention
- Important conclusions
```

## Context Poisoning

**Entry points**:
1. Tool outputs with errors/unexpected formats
2. Retrieved docs with incorrect/outdated info
3. Model-generated summaries with hallucinations

**Detection symptoms**:
- Degraded quality on previously successful tasks
- Tool misalignment (wrong tools/parameters)
- Persistent hallucinations

**Recovery**:
- Truncate to before poisoning point
- Explicit note + re-evaluation request
- Restart with clean context, preserve only verified info

## Model Degradation Thresholds

Every model degrades well before its advertised context window is full: retrieval
accuracy and instruction adherence slip first, then fall sharply. Onset points
differ per model and move with every release, so treat the symptoms above as the
signal rather than a fixed token number, and read the current window and limits
from the provider's own model documentation for the model you are running.

## Four-Bucket Mitigation

1. **Write**: Save externally (scratchpads, files)
2. **Select**: Pull only relevant (retrieval, filtering)
3. **Compress**: Reduce tokens (summarization)
4. **Isolate**: Split across sub-agents (partitioning)

## Detection Heuristics

```python
def calculate_health(utilization, degradation_risk, poisoning_risk):
    """Health score: 1.0 = healthy, 0.0 = critical"""
    score = 1.0
    score -= utilization * 0.5 if utilization > 0.7 else 0
    score -= degradation_risk * 0.3
    score -= poisoning_risk * 0.2
    return max(0, score)

# Thresholds: healthy >0.8, warning >0.6, degraded >0.4, critical <=0.4
```

## Guidelines

1. Monitor context length vs performance correlation
2. Place critical info at beginning/end
3. Implement compaction before degradation
4. Validate retrieved docs before adding
5. Use versioning to prevent outdated clash
6. Segment tasks to prevent confusion
7. Design for graceful degradation
