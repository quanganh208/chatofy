# Observation and improvement

A background agent must remain inspectable by the coordinating agent and the
operator. Visibility means durable evidence and actionable controls, not an
open terminal window. Observation, verification and a controlled comparison
complete the improvement loop.

## Before dispatch

Record the job, attempt, supervisor run or native handle, requested and observed
runtime/provider/model, owned paths, input artifacts, deadline and acceptance
checks. A command name alone does not identify the underlying model family.

Choose evidence requirements per job. Short advisory work may need a final
result only. A long-running writer needs a durable handle, bounded capture,
completion evidence and a way to confirm cancellation. If the selected runtime
cannot provide these, choose another qualified route or disclose the blocked
requirement. Do not invent a common capability all runtimes must implement.

## Observe incrementally

Use the installed CLI help to verify these surfaces:

```bash
ak orchestrate status <run-id> --json
ak orchestrate events <run-id> --after <cursor> --limit 100 --json
ak orchestrate output <run-id> <job-id> --offset <bytes> --json
ak orchestrate diagnose <run-id> --json
```

- Keep a cursor per supervisor run and consume every page while `has_more`.
  Deduplicate by run and sequence; attempts distinguish retries.
- Snapshot status includes `all_settled`. A failed job can have live siblings;
  their ownership remains occupied. Orphaned/unknown work is unsettled.
- The supervisor records normalized lifecycle/tool/error/artifact events and
  parent identity when the runtime exposes them. Unsupported or malformed
  provider events are not fabricated into tool success.
- Keep liveness, activity and progress separate. Process identity establishes
  liveness; output/tool events establish activity; artifact/check validation
  establishes accepted progress. Provider progress is only a reported claim.
- A timestamp is meaningful only for what actually updated it. Never turn a
  launcher timestamp into a heartbeat, or tool-call count into percent done.
- Check `truncated`, `events_truncated`, `output_truncated` and observation
  errors. Absence of events after truncation is not absence of work.
- Capture is bounded before persistence and redacted. Prefer file/stdin prompt
  transport where supported; private invocation files still contain argv/env
  and must never be exported as a diagnostic bundle.

Use bounded waits and backoff when unchanged. Report new findings, completion,
errors or requests for input; repeated unchanged polling is noise. Read output
only when the event/snapshot cannot answer the current diagnostic question.

## Intervene with evidence

For a supervisor run, use `stop <run-id>` and confirm settled state. Never signal
from a copied PID. For internal jobs, use live native follow-up/interrupt when
supported and retain the handle, reason and outcome in coordinator evidence.
A request sent is not cancellation confirmed.

A suspected stall warrants inspection: current tool, last output, deadline,
permission request, quota/backoff, dependency and provider error. Silence alone
must not trigger replacement. No second writer may occupy the same boundary
while the previous process or native agent is uncertain.

Continue an attempt only when its scope still matches. Scope changes, runtime
fallbacks or replacement agents produce a new attempt with refreshed route
proof. Preserve the old attempt's partial output and worktree. Existing user
authority persists within its recorded scope; a retry does not expand it.

## Diagnose, replay and measure

`diagnose` emits a bounded observation bundle with a persisted snapshot,
journal page, captured output and explicit missing-evidence fields. It excludes
invocation/environment files. Use `events` and `output` to fetch omitted pages;
`status` is the separate live identity check. Review the bundle before sharing.

Replaying a journal reconstructs observations; it never re-executes tools or
promises deterministic model behavior. Convert the failure into a regression
case with fixed inputs, checks and a bounded budget. Compare first-pass accepted
results, artifact correctness, retries, interventions, time and observed cost.
Keep unknown usage/cost unknown and separate transport failure from bad output.

Aggregate comparable run-local metrics only. Include arbiter verdict and scope
when interpreting success rates. Better visibility supplies evidence; a verified
change and repeated evaluation establish improvement. Neither metrics nor an
agent may silently rewrite routing policy.
