# Ultra Verifier Mode (`--ultra`)

Best-of-5 independent candidate plans → single strongest-model verifier selection → materialize winner unchanged.

Follows the shared Ultra Verifier protocol in `../../core/skills/ak-brainstorm/references/ultra-verifier-mode.md`.

## Mode Exclusivity

- `--ultra` cannot combine with `--fast`, `--hard`, `--deep`, `--parallel`, `--two`, `--debate`, or `--auto` (see `planning-rules.md` → Mode Exclusivity). Conflict is a hard stop.

## Execution Sequence

1. **Build shared evidence packet**: Assemble task, constraints, scouted files, and rubric once.
2. **Scaffold plan directory**: Run `ak plan create` per `cli-integration.md` and set active plan pointers.
3. **Mandatory generated-file read pass**: Read scaffolded stubs per `cli-integration.md`.
4. **Dispatch 5 parallel `planner` subagents**: Each prompt carries identical evidence packet and writes to `{plan-dir}/reports/planner-ultra-candidate-{N}.md`.
5. **Usable candidate gate**: Require all 5 usable. Run one bounded re-dispatch of failed slots if needed.
6. **Anonymize & Verify**: Present 5 candidates to strongest-model verifier (`kongming`) as Candidate A..E.
7. **Materialize winner**: Write winning candidate into `plan.md` + `phase-*.md` unchanged; record ranking appendix in report.
8. **Run Red-Team & Validation gates**: Execute standard gates before task hydration.
